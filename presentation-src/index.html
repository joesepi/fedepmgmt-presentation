                        Thank you to CascadiaJS -- this is an awesome event and I am so honored to have been invited and to be sharing the stage with so many great speakers and to be informed by so much great content.<br>
                        The people running this event are doing a fantastic job. And it has been great meeting fellow attendees as well.<br>
                        Being a musician, I always thank the sound guy. He is also doing a stellar job. Big kudos all around.

                        FE DEP MGMT can be a hotly debated topic<br>
                        While I've had the pleasure of meeting some of you, I'd like to pretend that we are all buddies for this talk. We occasionally have drinks or coffee together. Maybe you watched my cat while was out of town. Maybe I went to school with your sister, whatever. Let's start with the premise that we are all friends and that we are all in this together. Hot debates lately and in the past as well. I don't want to get all kumbaya on you, but people get excited about this topic<br>

                            less verbose because we dont have all of the async wrapping<br>
                            In the commonJS format, you attach your component's functionality to exports (like you see in these examples)<br>
                            module.exports more than once will overwrite functionality<br>
                            However, in both commonJS and AMD, you can export your functionality mapped to an object, essentially an api of sorts, let me show you some examples...

You can imagine if you had a model or a collection, some utils, ya know, whatever else you may need, this dep array can get ugly and you have to manage the corresponding function arguments.

Require's config, which we haven't talked about at all yet, can be painful as things get complex, especially when you are looking at testing and code coverage. Similarly, if your app gets complex, you will most certainly run up against limitations of Browserify too.</p>

                        What about ES6 modules?! I am glad you asked<br>
                        ES6 modules are currently being designed and they look promising. And as I was saying, I hope that this heated debate is informing that design. And in the end, this debate between these two camps may be moot in due time. And while being able to use them directly may be a ways off, you can start using them today and transpile or convert them to the flavor of your choice. I heard some folks discussing this on shuttle and actually, I'd like to hear more of people's experience doing this.
